# Spring Boot + Spring AOP

This is a simple example to show you how Spring AOP works with Spring Boot.

# Libraries and Tools
* [Module] [`Spring Boot`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Module] `Spring AOP`
* [Library for auto-generating getters, setters, constructors and others] [`Lombok`](https://projectlombok.org/)

# How it works
It is just a maven Spring Boot application which you can build and run it like any other Spring Boot application.
Execute the `ServiceAopSpringBootTest` test class to monitor aspects.
